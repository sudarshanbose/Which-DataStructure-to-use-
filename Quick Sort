1)Quick sort is the fastest, but it is not always O(N*log N), as there are worst cases where it becomes O(N2).

2)Quicksort is probably more effective for datasets that fit in memory. For larger data sets it proves to be
  inefficient so algorithms like merge sort are preferred in that case.

3)Quick Sort is an in-place sort (i.e. it doesnâ€™t require any extra storage) so it is appropriate to use 
  it for arrays.
