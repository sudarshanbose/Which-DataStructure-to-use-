1)It works well with large datasets where the items are almost sorted because it takes only one 
  iteration to detect whether the list is sorted or not. But if the list is unsorted to a large extend
    then this algorithm holds good for small datasets or lists.
    
2)This algorithm is fastest on an extremely small or nearly sorted set of data.
