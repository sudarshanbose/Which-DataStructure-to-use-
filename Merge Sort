1)Merge sort is used when the data structure doesnâ€™t support random access since it works with pure 
  sequential access that is forward iterators, rather than random access iterators.

2)It is widely used for external sorting, where random access can be very, very expensive compared to
  sequential access.

3)It is used where it is known that the data is similar data.

4)Merge sort is fast in the case of a linked list.

5)It is used in the case of a linked list as in a linked list for accessing any data at some index we need 
  to traverse from the head to that index and merge sort accesses data sequentially and the need of random 
    access is low.

6)The main advantage of the merge sort is its stability, the elements compared equally retain their original order.
